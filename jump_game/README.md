- **ESC** - Pause/Resume game
- **M** - Toggle sound
- **F** - Toggle fullscreen

### Game Mechanics
1. **Survive** as long as possible by avoiding obstacles
2. **Collect power-ups** to gain special abilities
3. **Score points** by surviving and passing obstacles
4. **Progress through levels** as difficulty increases
5. **Beat your high score** and unlock achievements

### Pro Tips
